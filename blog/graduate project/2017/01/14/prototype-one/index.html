            <p>For my first prototype I looked at a range of Gormley sculptures to be inspired by their form. From here I moved into Cinema4D to create a scale 3D model of what I wanted to build to try it out. I want the models be the same height as me and the 3D model made reflects this. As this is a prototype I made it at 1/2 scale to save on material. The physical model was made out of 5mm foam board which was glued together.</p>

<p>At this stage my focus is on the physical models as this is the part which will be the most difficult for me in the project. I am also trying to construct a decent workflow for this so I can setup and get the project running as quickly and easily as possible. At the moment I am using After Effects to render some glitchy videos, then placing those into VDMX. I’m using VDMX so that I could potentially add interactivity in the future and also distort the videos further making them look more glitchy. I then syphon out to Madmapper and then map it onto the model.</p>

<h3 id="current-challenges">Current Challenges</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Every time I move the projector or model I have to re-map and mask the image all over again. I don’t think this is avoidable but I need to find out if I can do it faster.</li>
  <li>Originally I planned to have the projector mounted on the ceiling, however having these sculptures mapped right down to the floor I don’t think this is feasible (and I can’t test ceiling mounting in my bedroom). In the future I will need to experiment with projector placement</li>
  <li>Foamboard is quite expensive and I don’t think it has the structural integrity to withstand being a full kurt-sized model. I will need to find a new material I can use for the models which are sturdier.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How could I experiment further with the form?</li>
  <li>What if the boxes were at different angles rather than all forward facing?</li>
  <li>Could I add texture or use different materials to explore the effects?</li>
</ul>
