            <p>After a couple of weeks of cutting and gluing foamboard, the sculptures are finally finished. This now means its time to move onto the next phase of the project: developing the projections and working out how to set up the project for the exhibition.</p>

<p>The models started each with a base of MDF which I painted black so that it’s non-obtrusive. I then measured and cut some wood to create the armatures for the sitting and standing models. The next four photos show some progression of these armatures. They were screwed and glued together/ to the bases and an extra piece was added for stability. It also shows how the boxes were built around the armature for support.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2017/04/armature-4.jpg" alt="Wooden Armature" /></p>

<p>Some of the larger boxes have extra pieces hidden inside which provide more strength and make the overall model more rigid.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2017/03/full-lying-3.jpg" alt="Full size lying" /></p>

<p>The wooden armature inside each of the standing and sitting models provides a more strength and stability than I anticipated. They can withstand being lightly pushed and wobbled without breaking which I was quite surprised by. At them moment the lying sculptures is in four unconnected parts: The baseboard, lower body, upper body, and one arm. This is so that it can be more easily moved when needed.</p>

<p>There is a slight issue at the moment that the standing and sitting models don’t fit through the doorway into my bedroom where there is a little more room for testing. As such, I’ve had to try to test them in the living room which is smaller. There isn’t enough room in the living room for me to project onto the standing man or more than one model so I’ve only done a quick test with the sitting model to see how it looked. In a dark room the effect was really impressive, like, <em>really</em> impressive. The projection is bright and striking and I can’t wait to see how it looks when across three full scale models.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2017/03/full-sitting-glitched.jpg" alt="Sitting glitched" /></p>

<p>To <em>just about</em> cover the sitting man, I needed ~3.25m between the front of the model and the projector. This will need to be even further to cover the standing model. I am hoping that I’ll be able to mount the projectors on the ceiling and that this might help with my coverage issue, but I will need to check with the uni if this is feasible and then test it to see if it is actually an improvement. My other idea is to have the projector on its side at 90 degrees so the height is the larger dimension, but at the moment I don’t have a method of securely positioning the projector in this way so it will have to wait.</p>

<p>I have come to the realisation that this isn’t going to be possible with a single projector. My current hope is to be able to do it with two projectors, but it may require three. This is my next main focus and I am currently working on procuring a space large enough for me to be able to test with the full scale models. I will also need to consider health and safety as I need to ensure the projectors and protruding cables don’t becomes hazards.</p>

<p>However, this doesn’t mean I’m completely stuck in the meantime. I’m still working on my glitch projections and coming up with ideas to try. I came up a lists of goals and ideas as a starting point.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make it appear as though these physical sculptures/ objects are glitching or malfunctioning in a digital way</li>
  <li>Must invoke the uncanny</li>
  <li>Blurs the boundaries between real and simulated, physical and digital</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Keep it simple with using just glitch effects and having parts of the sculptures seemingly disappear/ change colour/ etc.</li>
  <li>The level of glitch could change based on external factors. Or there could be a number of different ‘scenes’ with different styles of glitch</li>
  <li>Use face tracking to put the viewers face on the sculptures then glitch/ distort them sculptures and faces</li>
  <li>Distorted body parts (eyes, hands, feet, etc.) could glitch into appearance. This could perhaps be interactive in a way for example using sound monitoring</li>
</ul>
