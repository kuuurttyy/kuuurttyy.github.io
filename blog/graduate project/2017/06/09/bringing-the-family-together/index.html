            <p>After many weeks of waiting, I am finally able to test the project fully with all three models together. I now have the opertinity to try out different layouts and styles to see how the final project will look.</p>

<p>Step one involved chosing an arrangement for three models and the 2 projectors. The goal was to get the best coverage on the models but taking up the least space as I need to be considerate of other people’s projects at the show. I am hoping that I’ll be able to use a corner at the exhibiton as it will block off 2 possible directions people could come from. At the moment I have the sitting and standing models staggered at the back and the lying model in front of them. The distance between and taken up by the models and projects is quite large, but I’m hoping this isn’t an issue in the exhibition space.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/2017/06/space-1.jpg" alt="The space" /></p>

<p>If the exhibiton space allows I’d like to spread it out a bit more, so that it isn’t so compressed but I’ll find out if I can do this in a week or so. I also need to be conscious that the sitting and standing models are using the same projector so they can’t be too far from each other or at too different depths or the projections wont be in focus.</p>

<p>With my current layout, there are two possible viewing angles which work well: one face on and another from the side which lets the audience see one side and the front. The viewing is split by the placement of the projectors so I will need to make sure that no one will knock or jog them as it will ruin the mapping.</p>

<hr />

<p>For this testing, I am using my old Macbook and a Dualhead2go so that I can run two projectors off a single output. However the Dualhead2go the uni has isn’t the version that is compatable with mac so it doesn’t work as well as it should. it SHOULD output a double wide video  (2 * 1920px x 1080px) and then each projector uses half of that, but as this one isn’t supported, it only puts out a single width video and spreads it across the two. This means each projector is actually running at 960px x 1080px which is a weird resolution. In the show this shouldn’t be an issue as I am planning on borrowing a mac from the uni which as two video outputs anyway.</p>

<hr />

<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XXLta6xic0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>In the video there are three main variations, each shows from the two viewing angles. The first variant is one of the standard glitch aesthetics I’ve been using as I really like it. The sculptures are constantly lit and there are coloured fragmenets jumping about the place. The second introduces the Glitch FBO effect from VDMX which is randomly tuned on and off. This results in moments which are REALLY glitchy and is far more chaotic. Having the effect turn on and off randomly allows for some great contrast between stillness and utter glitchy chaos. The final variant builds on the second and thows in some eyes during the extra glitchy moments as they’re controlled in the same way. This was more interesting than expected and I plan on working out a good scale and amount of eyes/ other features to use for the show.</p>

<p>As there are so many different glitchy styles and aesthetics, my current plan is to create a series of loops which will cycle through and repeat throughout the exhibiton. So instead of it being 5 hours straight of a single effect, I could great some 5 minute loops for example and play through them. I think this will make it more interesting for an extended period of time as there is more variation. The next step is to come up with the loops!</p>
