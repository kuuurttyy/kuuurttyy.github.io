Testing was done using one minute loops played back at around half speed to reduce the framerate for both performance and aesthetic reasons (so the glitches aren’t as fast).</p>

                    <p>Following on from my last post, I jumped in to designing my full scale models so that I can begin building them. For this, as usual, I used Cinema4D so that I can model them to the exact dimensions I need and be able to see how they will look in relation to each other and at the correct scale. With some help, I gathered some measurements of myself, to use along side my reference images so that I could make sure I was designing at the right dimensions. From here I used some of my previous models for inspiration and got to work.</p>

                    <p>Last weekend I came up with my concept of the uncanny and presented it to my tutor and peers to get some feedback. Luckily the idea went down a treat which means I can sleep a bit easier at night and not stress about coming up with a concept. This part has been the most challenging so far as we haven’t been trained in art or art history so it is quite far out of the norm of what we’re used to. However the next challenge, will probably be even harder.</p>

                    <p>For my first prototype I looked at a range of Gormley sculptures to be inspired by their form. From here I moved into Cinema4D to create a scale 3D model of what I wanted to build to try it out. I want the models be the same height as me and the 3D model made reflects this. As this is a prototype I made it at 1/2 scale to save on material. The physical model was made out of 5mm foam board which was glued together.</p>
