        <title>Graduate Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the dissertation out of the way and the foundation research and dossier complete, its now time to begin the arduous task of making my graduate project idea a reality. This blog will act as a place to chart my explorations and findings as I continue to develop/ hone my idea and eventually realise the project for the end exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project I proposed is titled “Gormley to Glitch” and is a projection mapping installation. The idea was to combine sculptural forms inspired by the works of Antony Gormley with glitch art to explore the physicality of the digital medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge now is to develop this further: shifting away from a reliance on Gormley towards something more original, creative and unique. As I lack any formal training in fine art, this part will be the most difficult. It will requre coming up with ideas which are less linear, less predictable. I need to take a step sideways (perhaps into another dimension) not forward. In the coming weeks I plan to try and find this inspiration from within, avoiding conventional sources of inspiration to come up with something original.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Portfolio Website &amp; Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been here before, you may notice that something is different about this place…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again I’ve taken it upon myself to redesign my portfolio website as I was getting bored of the old design. I took this as an opportunity to try something a little bit different to my previous designs and as a chance to learn how to use Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I had my main portfolio site as static content and had my blog under a directory and powered by Wordpress. However with this set up I found it too tedious to edit and update my portfolio and I Wordpress seemed a bit excessive for my needs. Using Jekyll is a great way to make portfolio management AND blog management much easier and to link them together in a static site, making it nice and speedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad news is that I’ve pretty much lost all of my old blog posts as my previous hosting got canceled before, and like an idiot I didn’t have a complete back up of my blog. This means that all of the written records of my work from first and second year have disappeared… for now. I’ll see what I can do to try and recover this information but don’t get your hopes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news this site is still very much a work in progress. Still to come is a better design for this blog section, as I was lacking inspiration here, and some hopefully some fancy animations.&lt;/p&gt;
