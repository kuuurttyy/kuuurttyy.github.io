        <title>Prototype One</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For my first prototype I looked at a range of Gormley sculptures to be inspired by their form. From here I moved into Cinema 4D to create a scale 3D model of what I wanted to built to try it out. I want the models be the same height as me and the 3D model made reflects this. As this is a prototype I made it at 1/2 scale to save on material. The physical model was made out of 5mm foam board which was glued together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage my focus is on the physical models as this is the part which will be the most difficult for me in the project. I am also trying to construct a decent workflow for this so I can setup and get the project running as quickly and easily as possible. At the moment I am using After Effects to render some glitchy videos, then placing those into VDMX. I’m using VDMX so that I could potentially add interactivity in the future and also distort the videos further making them look more glitchy. I then syphon out to Madmapper and then map it onto the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-challanges&quot;&gt;Current Challanges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every time I move the projector or model I have to re-map and mask the image all over again. I don’t think this is avoidable but I need to find out if I can do it faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Originally I planned to have the projector mounted on the ceiling, however having these sculptures mapped right down to the floor I dont think this is feasible (and I can’t test ceiling mounting in my bedroom). In the future I will need to experiment with projector placement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foamboard is quite expensive and I dont think it has the structural integrity to withstand being a full kurt-sized model. I will need to find a new material I can use for the models which are sturdier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How could I experiment further with the form?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would happen if the boxes were missing their front faces and the projector shon into the hollow space?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if the boxes were at different angles rather than all forward facing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Could I add texture or use different materials to explore the effects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Graduate Project Start</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the dissertation out of the way and the foundation research and dossier complete, its now time to begin the arduous task of making my graduate project idea a reality. This blog will act as a place to chart my explorations and findings as I continue to develop/ hone my idea and eventually realise the project for the end exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this section in the blog is to chart the development of my project from the initual pitch until the exhibition. It is a place to for me to organise my thoughts and feelings and express this as the work evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project I proposed is titled “Gormley to Glitch” and is a projection mapping installation. The idea was to combine sculptural forms inspired by the works of Antony Gormley with glitch art to explore the physicality of the digital medium. The dossier mapping the development of this work can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/blog/2017/01/kurt-stubbings-dossier.pdf&quot;&gt;here (4.5mb)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge now is to develop this further: shifting away from a reliance on Gormley towards something more original, creative and unique. As I lack any formal training in fine art, this part will be the most difficult. It will requre coming up with ideas which are less linear, less predictable. I need to take a step sideways (perhaps into another dimension) not forward. In the coming weeks I plan to try and find this inspiration from within, avoiding conventional sources of inspiration to come up with something original.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Portfolio Website &amp; Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been here before, you may notice that something is different about this place…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again I’ve taken it upon myself to redesign my portfolio website as I was getting bored of the old design. I took this as an opportunity to try something a little bit different to my previous designs and as a chance to learn how to use Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I had my main portfolio site as static content and had my blog under a directory and powered by Wordpress. However with this set up I found it too tedious to edit and update my portfolio and I Wordpress seemed a bit excessive for my needs. Using Jekyll is a great way to make portfolio management AND blog management much easier and to link them together in a static site, making it nice and speedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad news is that I’ve pretty much lost all of my old blog posts as my previous hosting got canceled before, and like an idiot I didn’t have a complete back up of my blog. This means that all of the written records of my work from first and second year have disappeared… for now. I’ll see what I can do to try and recover this information but don’t get your hopes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news this site is still very much a work in progress. Still to come is a better design for this blog section, as I was lacking inspiration here, and some hopefully some fancy animations.&lt;/p&gt;
