        <title>Mini Models</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After deciding on wanting three models for the installation, I thought it was about time to start doing some tests with some scale models and experiment with different glitch projections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step involved getting some source images to work from of myself. With the help of a friend, I frolicked around for a little bit as they took pictures of me in differnt poses giving me a starting point for modelling. This process was inspired by the way Gormley operated, using his own body for his sculptural works. From here I then took some measurements of myself, did some quick maths to work out scale sizes and sketched up some ideas. These are shown below. I have no idea what most of these numbers mean anymore but at least it provides evidence of… something. For the mini models im working at 1/8 scale so that they’re around 22cm tall. Using the measurements I took, I started designing a couple of models in Cinema4D at the correct scale, This allowed me to visualise better how they would look before moving to physical materials. It also gave me the dimensions I needed to quickly and easily cut out the foamboard and glue it together - Each one still took over 5 hours to make though! You may have noticed that the standing model has a different ‘aesthetic’ to the other two - this is becuase I reused one of the scale models I had built before as I didn’t want to delay progressing by another day to build yet ANOTHER scale model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/2017/03/model-source.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Selection of some of the source photos taken&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/2017/03/model-maths.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Some measurements and sketches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/2017/03/mini-model-c4d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Models mocked up in Cinema4D&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrangement of the models in this scaled version is rather arbitrary, I just placed them in a way that seemed acceptable to project onto with a single projector and cover a sufficient amount of the surfaces to make it look cool. Ideally in the real model I’d like to be able to project directly downwards onto the sculpture, inviting people to come closer and view the projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping onto this was kind of a nightmare. With such complex shapes, its quite a task to perfectly map onto them so I had to settle for some rather crude mapping with quite a lot of bleeds - thank God this is just a prototype. I built a VDMX layout so that I could work with the different sculptures and easily be able to customise the projection for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/blog/2017/03/model-vdmx.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VDMX Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long time setting up, I was finally able to start projecting some different ideas. I’ve made a quick compilation video to show some of the different types. It’s worth noting that this is very difficult to film as the camera on my phone struggles with the crazy flashing lights. Below is a commentary about each test to share what the idea was and my thoughts on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed//zxk8Lp8GGSw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard glitching:&lt;/strong&gt; This one was the logical starting point moving from a singluar sculpture to a three. The Glitch has the same settings across each model, but with a different seed so that the exact glitch pattern isn’t the same. While it looks alright, it doesn’t seem to have any depth or meaning, it’s a bit dull in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard glitching plus:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a slight variation on the first clip, but with the addition of the Glitch FBO effect in VDMX to the lying sculpture. This effect basically mangles data from the graphics card resulting in some wild, fast and crazy glitch effects. I changed how the mapping works a little for this one so that the projection from the lying sculpture can slightly interfere with the other two - it doesn’t come across very well in the video but it totally does it. The idea for this one was associated with freud’s notion of the id as the unconscious mind and primal desires. I imagine this being rapid, quickly changing, chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RGB:&lt;/strong&gt; This idea is inspired by the red, green and blue colour separation of displays (and by the cones in our eyes). It separates the three colours, one to each sculpture and then just adds some glitchy effects to it for good measure. I think this idea has some potential but I’ll need to rationalise the colour separation, and better usilise it to communicate something.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark sculptures:&lt;/strong&gt; In pretty much all of my tests prior, I started with some base colour projection, usually white, then add the glitch to that. This meant that the sculptures were always lit and bright. In this idea, only the glitches introduce bright, fast, colourful flashes of light which are chaotic and disorientating. Unfortunately I had to film it in quite a bright room as my camera couldn’t handle the sudden changes in light levels very well, but I assure you it looks very good in a dimly lit room. Scaled up, I can imagine this effect being quite incredible as the sculptures fleetingly flash into life and disappear and instant later. If the room was dark enough it would be difficult to take in the sculptures as a whole, instead they would be interpreted through brief fragments as they show themselves then disappear back into the darkness. This idea definitely has potential (especially as I really like it).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature imagery:&lt;/strong&gt; This idea is inspired by discussions had with my tutor and peers. For it I chose some nature videos from YouTube pretty much from random, just to test the appearance of projecting imagery onto the sculptures rather than simply ‘glitch’. I then glitched them in VDMX. The result was quite interesting. The glitchy videos were very chaotic which I found entertaining and hypnotic. Having them constantly glitch meant that it was quite difficult to comprehend what the imagery was of. Plus the shape of the sculptures themselves don’t really commend themselves as canvases for watching 16:9 video content.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio-reactive nature imagery:&lt;/strong&gt; Because I could, I made the glitches audio-reactive so that they would turn on and off and change intensity based on audio detection. This is just an example of a potential interaction method, as I would like to add interactivity to the project if it can help get a message across. Having the glitch controlled by mused created a sense of purpose or intent for the glitch, as it if had some more solid meaning for being there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main isue with these last two examples is the introduction of imagery/ video content projected onto the sculptures. Doing so, for me at least, distracts from the fact that they’re sculptures at all. They’re shaped like people, they’re formidable and have a sense of presence. I think this takes it too far from being a sculpture in the traditional sense. Sculptures are motionless, eternal figures which solidify a moment in time and tears itself from its bounds. I want it to look as if the sculptures themselves are glitching, not the content projected onto the sculptures glitching, which is why im apprehensive to add specific imagery. Sculptures don’t glitch. BUT these ones are. They are physical objects seemingly malfunctioning in a digital way. Yet these sculptures are not digital, how is this possible? The comination of glitch and sculpture breaks down the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds. It allows us to see a digital phenomenon more physically, and in a way, something a physical phenomenon more digitally. This idea fits nicely with the paradigm shift in how we consume the majority of our media and art. It breaks from how we usually experience sculptural works. Sculptures are still, calm, serene, but these ones are confusing, chaotic, yet mesmerising. The eternal beauty and stillness of the sculpture is rudely interrupted by bright flashes of colour, fragments seemingly diappearing and reappearing, all in a way which goes beyond our established relationship with sculpture. For me, it breaks the traditional awe associated with physical art and creates something slightly uncomfortable because the fleeting moments of digital chaotic beauty are almost impossible to catch. The beauty is not so much in the form of the sculpture but in the glitch moments, the moments you may never encounter again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now you may be thinking: Why are the sculptures people? Why not different trees or something? Well, while writing that last paragraph I had an idea. Using the human form for the sculptures makes them more relatable. They may be abstracted, and expressionless combinations of white boxes, but they serve as a blank canvas for projecting ones self. In my case especially, as these sculptures are modeled on my dimensions I can only imagine the effect will be rather &lt;em&gt;uncanny&lt;/em&gt;. Having these three Kurt-sized models staring back at me should be quite an experience. The sculptures are strangely familiar. The variety of poses (standing, sitting and lying) makes them more human, more relatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this brings us to my idea. &lt;strong&gt;The uncanny&lt;/strong&gt;. In an amazing stroke of luck, it brings us back to our good friend, Sigmund Freud, the starting point for the investigation with his work on the human psyche. The uncanny is a psychological concept which describes something that is strangely familiar and foreign such that it creates a feeling of discomfort. It can create a sort of cognitive dissonance due to being attracted to yet repulsed by an object, in this case, the glitching sculptures. Uncanniness was first explored by Ernst Jentsch who described it as a product of ‘intellectual uncertainty’ caused by something which is not fully understood. For me, the digital fits this perfectly, especially when it malfunctions or glitches. Its something most of us encounter on a daily basis, yet in a way it has remained rather mysterious. These magical boxes which light up and allow us to access unlimited amounts of information instantly. Unfortunately the ubiquity of the digital has normalised this, but if I just sit and think, it just astounds me and makes me feel quite uncomfortable. Freud developed the concept of the uncanny, specifically an aspect of the word derived from German etymology. Uncanny comes from the German word &lt;em&gt;unheimlich&lt;/em&gt; which applies to things which were intended to remain secret, hidden away, but have come into the open. Sound familiar? In my previous writings I’ve mentioned how glitches serve as breaks in the usual or expected flows of information. They reveal the computational nature of the digital which exists outside of our representations. Glitches unmask the veil of the screen, revealing the true nature of the software behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re seeing something in a broken or malfunctioning state. I can only really talk for myself, but I don’t usually like broken things. I like things to be precise, perfect, but there is something about glitches which are strangely enticing and beautiful. They’re chaotic and confusing, seemingly beyond my control, yet the flashes of colour in all their distorted glory mesmerise me. This point can be linked back to an argument Frued made about the uncanny. The uncanny is what unconsciously reminds us of our own id, our forbidden and unconscious desires. This is percieved as threatening by our superego. The items and people we project our repressed impulses upon become uncanny threats. For example zombies are uncanny. They’re humanlike, but they’re dead and they eat people. We find zombies uncanny becuase they’re so almost human but we don’t want to be associated with them. It could also be to do with our fear of death, and perhaps some peoples repressed desires to eat other people. So could the uncanny appeal of glitch be playing on people’s fear of being broken, or being seen in a way that reveals our hidden thoughts and desires? Maybe…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, seeing human shaped sculptures glitch is uncanny. It’s taken me a while to realise what was so interesting about it and I think I’ve finally worked it out. They’re sculptures, sculptures don’t glitch. They’re people, people don’t glitch. Yet here we are. It’s weird. It’s uncomfortable. It’s uncanny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little side note about any arguments one might have to do with me talking about glitch as being a result computational error -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of glitches used in the work thus far are simulations. Theyre generated using a tool which allows for so much freedom in recreating the glitch aesthetic its amazing. This allows me to fine-tune the glitch projected onto the sculptures but theyre still chaotic, random and beautiful. However from the perspective of the audience, they (generally) don’t know that it is a simulation, so they will percieve them as real glitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the effects used in VDMX does, in a way, result in real glitch. It works by distorting data taken from the graphics card resulting in actual glitches. This, when combined with my simulated glitches disrupts the boundary between real and simulated to the point that no one has any idea whats going on anymore. However this effect needs to be used sparingly as it, due to its nature, it can result in crashes - which is not what I want.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Artistic Development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks have been spent trying to ‘find enlightenment’ and come up with some creative and original ideas to develop this project further. The focus of this thinking has been on finding a way to make the sculptural forms themselves more meaningful. Following a meeting with my tutor to discuss possible directions, the beginnings of a concept began to emerge which will be explored in the coming week before solidifying the idea and putting it into production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is to be presented at a triptych of three sculptural forms, each with a projection mapped component. I want to have the forms in different poses: lying, sitting, and standing, representing the three parts of the psyche suggested in Freud’s structural model. As with the psyche, these three parts work together to form a singular whole, in the work the forms and their glitches will be interrelated contributing to a singular entity representing the mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analogy also fits in line with ideas from cognitive psychology and viewing the individual as a process of information, much like a computer. The environment provides data which is transformed by the senses. This information is then processed and can be stored, retrieved, and transformed using ‘mental programs’ which results in a behavioural response. In general we selectively attend to a singular activity, and ignore other stimulation. This is because humans have a limited processing capability. So what would happen if we were to overload this processing capability? Would it result in a glitch like in a computer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently my challenge is integrating these ideas with digital media, and in particular how glitch art would fit into this model and compliment the chosen poses for the forms. Here’s a short summary of my current thinking and understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;id&quot;&gt;Id&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The id operates with the unconscious part of the mind. It is primitive, instinctual, illogical and irrational. It operates on the pleasure principle that every impulse should be satisfied immediately and does not change over time or with experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me the lying pose is the most suggestive of this. It implies sleeping or dreaming, when the unconscious mind is able to operate (mostly) free from external stimuli. Sleep is a basic, primal instinct and is unavoidable. Digitally I am imagining something fast paced to be projected, symbolising the impulsive and illogical side of the mind. How would glitches operate here? Would there even be glitches? Perhaps when basic instincts conflict, this could be a glitch. Such as when you’re drifting off to sleep then you’re sudden twitched awake as the brain panics for some reason (I have no idea why this happens…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ego&quot;&gt;Ego&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ego is the part of the id which has been modified and influenced by the external world. It mediates between the unrealistic and irrational id and the external real world. It is integral to decision making and finds realistic ways to satisfy the demands of the id. The ego is rational, realistic and orientated towards problem solving by testing reality to find solutions - enabling people to demonstrate self-control and tame the id. However it has no concept of right or wrong, it only aims to gain pleasure without causing harm to the self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is more difficult to pin a pose on. On the one hand it fits well with sitting, as it is the logical intermediary step between lying and standing. But equally it could be standing as that pose is implicit of action, or going somewhere, which fits with the drive of the ego as it seeks to pleasure and fulfil the id’s wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;superego&quot;&gt;Superego&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly there is the superego which incorporates the values and morals of society learned from others. It controls the id’s impulses which are forbidden by culture and society and persuades the ego towards more moralistic goals rather than simple realistic ones. The superego consists of the conscience and the ideal self. The ideal self is an imaginary picture of how one ought to be such as career aspirations, how to treat others and how to behave properly as a member of society. Falling short of the ideal self results in guilt, whereas behaving in line with it or social norms is rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one I am also finding difficult to associate with a pose. Initially I thought it could be standing, as standing is the pose in which we often interact with society and our environment. Standing can be quite confident and it had a sense of ‘presence’ to it as if this standing figure IS the ideal self, standing tall and proud - what one should aspire to be. But I also think it fits with sitting. As it is a slightly less active pose than standing, it is suggestive of stopping and taking a moment to think. It could be analogous to the mind pondering the moral implications of an action desired by the id. However in this case, sitting doesn’t suggest the power that the superego has to control both the ego and the id which standing does as an authoritarian pose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;beep boop&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Form Experiments</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After creating my first prototype, I drew up a couple of alternate form ideas just to explore shapes and possibilities. This lead to the creation of two 1/8 scale models using the offcuts of foamboard to better visualise these forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took measurements of my body to try and get the proportions right as I’d like to use myself for the forms - similar to how Gormley works. In future I’ll need to find a volunteer to take pictures of me in various poses and from different angles so I have better reference material for abstracting my form.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prototype One</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For my first prototype I looked at a range of Gormley sculptures to be inspired by their form. From here I moved into Cinema 4D to create a scale 3D model of what I wanted to built to try it out. I want the models be the same height as me and the 3D model made reflects this. As this is a prototype I made it at 1/2 scale to save on material. The physical model was made out of 5mm foam board which was glued together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage my focus is on the physical models as this is the part which will be the most difficult for me in the project. I am also trying to construct a decent workflow for this so I can setup and get the project running as quickly and easily as possible. At the moment I am using After Effects to render some glitchy videos, then placing those into VDMX. I’m using VDMX so that I could potentially add interactivity in the future and also distort the videos further making them look more glitchy. I then syphon out to Madmapper and then map it onto the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-challanges&quot;&gt;Current Challanges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every time I move the projector or model I have to re-map and mask the image all over again. I don’t think this is avoidable but I need to find out if I can do it faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Originally I planned to have the projector mounted on the ceiling, however having these sculptures mapped right down to the floor I dont think this is feasible (and I can’t test ceiling mounting in my bedroom). In the future I will need to experiment with projector placement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foamboard is quite expensive and I dont think it has the structural integrity to withstand being a full kurt-sized model. I will need to find a new material I can use for the models which are sturdier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions&quot;&gt;Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How could I experiment further with the form?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What would happen if the boxes were missing their front faces and the projector shon into the hollow space?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if the boxes were at different angles rather than all forward facing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Could I add texture or use different materials to explore the effects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Graduate Project Start</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;With the dissertation out of the way and the foundation research and dossier complete, its now time to begin the arduous task of making my graduate project idea a reality. This blog will act as a place to chart my explorations and findings as I continue to develop/ hone my idea and eventually realise the project for the end exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this section in the blog is to chart the development of my project from the initual pitch until the exhibition. It is a place to for me to organise my thoughts and feelings and express this as the work evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project I proposed is titled “Gormley to Glitch” and is a projection mapping installation. The idea was to combine sculptural forms inspired by the works of Antony Gormley with glitch art to explore the physicality of the digital medium. The dossier mapping the development of this work can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/blog/2017/01/kurt-stubbings-dossier.pdf&quot;&gt;here (4.5mb)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge now is to develop this further: shifting away from a reliance on Gormley towards something more original, creative and unique. As I lack any formal training in fine art, this part will be the most difficult. It will requre coming up with ideas which are less linear, less predictable. I need to take a step sideways (perhaps into another dimension) not forward. In the coming weeks I plan to try and find this inspiration from within, avoiding conventional sources of inspiration to come up with something original.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Portfolio Website &amp; Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been here before, you may notice that something is different about this place…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again I’ve taken it upon myself to redesign my portfolio website as I was getting bored of the old design. I took this as an opportunity to try something a little bit different to my previous designs and as a chance to learn how to use Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously I had my main portfolio site as static content and had my blog under a directory and powered by Wordpress. However with this set up I found it too tedious to edit and update my portfolio and I Wordpress seemed a bit excessive for my needs. Using Jekyll is a great way to make portfolio management AND blog management much easier and to link them together in a static site, making it nice and speedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad news is that I’ve pretty much lost all of my old blog posts as my previous hosting got canceled before, and like an idiot I didn’t have a complete back up of my blog. This means that all of the written records of my work from first and second year have disappeared… for now. I’ll see what I can do to try and recover this information but don’t get your hopes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news this site is still very much a work in progress. Still to come is a better design for this blog section, as I was lacking inspiration here, and some hopefully some fancy animations.&lt;/p&gt;
